# My Portfolio Website Made With Flask!

## This is all the code for my portfolio website, using a template from https://html5up.net/

Super useful project that taught me how a proper webpage works. Here's what I did:
* Created the server using Flask
* Created the database for the messages of the "Contact Me" section
* Created the "Thank You" page for the people that send me a message
* Learned how to use Favicon to fully personalize my webpage
* Hosted the server in https://www.pythonanywhere.com/
